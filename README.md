The series of repositories include all texts—over 40,000—collected from open-access online libraries and collections of Arabic texts. All texts are automatically sorted into `RAWrabicaXXXXX` repositories---5,000 each (see, `_file_tree.txt` for details). Currently, the following collections are included:

* JK
* Shamela
* Sham30K
* Shia
* Falsafa
* GRAR
* Manchester

**NB**: Extra long texts are split into multiple files—they have suffixes `_a`, `_b`, `_c`, etc.
